TUIOdroid is an open source TUIO tracker for Android devices, which allows multi-touch remote control based on the <a href='http://www.tuio.org/'>TUIO protocol</a>. It is capable of sending standard TUIO/UDP messages through any active 3G or WIFI connection. This application is available free of charge on the Android Market and can be used in conjunction with any TUIO enabled client application. Its source code is also available under the terms of the GPL and therefore can be freely used for the creation of open source TUIO enabled mobile applications. Apart from that TUIOdroid is also a useful tool for the development and testing of TUIO 1.1 client implementations.

<b>Notice</b>: To support the further development of the TUIO platform, we are looking for hardware donations of iOS and Android tablet devices. We are planning object tracking support along with the according TUIO object profile implementation. Please get in touch with martin\_at\_tuio\_dot\_org for further information.

The application binary can be installed directly from the <a href='https://market.android.com/details?id=tuioDroid.impl'>Android Market</a>. If you are looking for a TUIO tracker on iOS devices please check out the <a href='https://code.google.com/p/tuiopad'>TuioPad</a> instead.
